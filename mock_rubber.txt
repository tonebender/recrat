According to Decker, notwithstanding the band's advances in 1964, music critics generally view ''Rubber Soul'' as the Beatles' {{"'}}transitional' album ... from successful pop act to unparalleled masters of the studio".{{sfn|Decker|2009|p=75}} It is frequently cited by commentators as the first of their "classic" albums.{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=62}} Greil Marcus described it as the best of all the band's LPs.{{sfn|Kruth|2015|p=9}} In his 1979 essay on the Beatles in ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll'', Marcus wrote: "''Rubber Soul'' was an album ''made'' as an album; with the exception of 'Michelle' (which, to be fair, paid the bills for years to come), every cut was an inspiration, something new and remarkable in and of itself."{{sfn|Marcus|1992|pp=220–21}}{{refn|group=nb|Marcus also said that it was this album focus that nullified any potential argument "that the Beatles' first four LPs, in their British configurations (''Please Please Me'', ''With the Beatles'', ''A Hard Day's Night'' and ''Beatles for Sale''), were as good as ''Rubber Soul''".{{sfn|Marcus|1992|p=220}}}}

[[Neil McCormick]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote in 2009: "this is where things start to get very interesting&nbsp;... ''Rubber Soul'' is the result of their first extended period in the studio. The production is open and spacious, adorned but not yet overcrowded with new instruments and ideas. The songs themselves are like little [[Pop Art]] vignettes, where the lyrics are starting to match the quality of the melodies and arrangements."{{sfn|Womack|2014|p=793}} Scott Plagenhoef of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' describes the album as "the most important artistic leap in the Beatles' career – the signpost that signaled a shift away from Beatlemania and the heavy demands of teen pop, toward more introspective, adult subject matter".<ref name="Plagenhoef" /> Paul Du Noyer wrote in his review for ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' in 2004: "Their talent was already a source of wonder, but now the songs themselves were turning mysterious. Under the influence of Bob Dylan – and, it might be said, marijuana – the Fab Four laced their tunefulness with new introspection, wordplay and social comment. University professors and newspaper columnists started taking note."<ref name="DuNoyer/Blender" />

Writing in ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', [[Mark Kemp]] says that the influence of Dylan and the Byrds seems overt at times but the album marks the start of the Beatles' peak in creativity and, in the context of 1965, offered "an unprecedented synthesis of elements from folk-rock and beyond".<ref name="Kemp/Paste">{{cite magazine |last=Kemp |first=Mark |date=8 September 2009 |title=The Beatles: The Long and Winding Repertoire |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/09/the-beatles-the-long-and-winding-repertoire.html |url-status=live |magazine=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |page= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023065059/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/09/the-beatles-the-long-and-winding-repertoire.html |archive-date=23 October 2013 |access-date=26 October 2019}}</ref> According to [[Richie Unterberger]] of [[AllMusic]], the album's lyrics represented "a quantum leap in terms of thoughtfulness, maturity, and complex ambiguities", while the music was similarly progressive in its use of sounds beyond "the conventional instrumental parameters of the rock group". He adds that ''Rubber Soul'' is "full of great tunes" from Lennon and McCartney notwithstanding their divergence from a common style, and demonstrates that Harrison "was also developing into a fine songwriter".<ref name="Unterberger/AM" /> Writing in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]'', [[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]] describes it as "not a collection of would-be hits or favourite cover versions … but a startlingly diverse collection, ranging from the pointed satire of 'Nowhere Man' to the intensely reflective 'In My Life'."{{sfn|Larkin|2006|p=487}} In the 2004 edition of ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] recognises ''Help!'' as "the first chapter in the [Beatles'] astounding creative takeoff", after which the band "grew up with an album of bittersweet romance, singing adult love ballads that feel worldly but not jaded".{{sfn|Brackett|Hoard|2004|pp=52–53}}

In an article coinciding with the 50th anniversary of its release, for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Bob Stanley (musician)|Bob Stanley]] lamented that ''Rubber Soul'' was often overlooked in appraisals of the Beatles' recording career, whereas ''Revolver'' and ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' had each gained in stature to surpass ''Sgt. Pepper''. Stanley highlighted ''Rubber Soul'' as having been "a good 18 months ahead of its time" and "the first album of the rock era that ''sounded'' like an album".<ref>{{cite web |last=Stanley |first=Bob |author-link=Bob Stanley (musician) |date=4 December 2015 |title=The Beatles' Rubber Soul is 50: and it's still ahead of its time |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/03/the-beatles-rubber-soul-50-still-ahead-of-its-time |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322092831/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/03/the-beatles-rubber-soul-50-still-ahead-of-its-time |archive-date=22 March 2016 |access-date=31 March 2016 |website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Also writing in December 2015, in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Sheffield especially admired the singing and the modern qualities of the female characters depicted in the lyrics. He said that the album was "way ahead of what anyone had done before" and, given the short period in which they had to record, he called it the Beatles' "accidental masterpiece".<ref name="Sheffield/RS">{{cite magazine |last=Sheffield |first=Rob |date=4 December 2015 |title=50 Years of 'Rubber Soul' is 50: How the Beatles Invented the Future of Pop |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/50-years-of-rubber-soul-how-the-beatles-invented-the-future-of-pop-20151203#ixzz44RgvHfFc |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330235756/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/50-years-of-rubber-soul-how-the-beatles-invented-the-future-of-pop-20151203#ixzz44RgvHfFc |archive-date=30 March 2016 |access-date=31 March 2016 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>

Conversely, Jon Friedman of ''Esquire'' finds the work vastly overrated, with only the Lennon-dominated songs "Norwegian Wood", "Nowhere Man", "In My Life" and "Girl" worthy of praise, and he dismisses it as "dull" and "the Beatles' most inconsequential album".<ref>{{cite web |last=Friedman |first=Jon |date=3 December 2015 |title=''Rubber Soul'' is the Most Overrated Album of All Time |url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/news/a40183/rubber-soul-overrated-fiftieth-anniversary/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323203705/http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/news/a40183/rubber-soul-overrated-fiftieth-anniversary/ |archive-date=23 March 2016 |access-date=31 March 2016 |website=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]}}</ref> Although he considers that McCartney "comes off third-string" to Lennon and Harrison, Plagenhoef defends the album's subtle mood; highlighting the influence of cannabis on the Beatles throughout 1965, he writes: "With its patient pace and languid tones, ''Rubber Soul'' is an altogether much more mellow record than anything the Beatles had done before, or would do again. It's a fitting product from a quartet just beginning to explore their inner selves on record."<ref name="Plagenhoef" /> In his review for [[Rough Guides]], Chris Ingham highlights the musical arrangements, three-part harmonies and judicious use of new sounds, in addition to the band's improved musicianship and songwriting. He says that ''Rubber Soul'' usually trails the Beatles' next four albums in critics' assessments of their work, yet "it's undoubtedly their pre-acid, pre-antagonism masterpiece: beat music as high art".{{sfn|Ingham|2006|p=35}}{{refn|group=nb|In 2020, when asked of which Beatles albums qualified for an A-plus grade, Christgau considered ''Rubber Soul'' as a "prime candidate" among scholars of the band, but concluded that, "while I feel and understand the artistic skill and historical momentousness{{nbsp}}... in fact I only cream for three of its songs: 'Norwegian Wood,' 'Girl,' and 'In My Life.{{'"}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=16 June 2021|url=https://robertchristgau.substack.com/p/xgau-sez-june-2021|title=Xgau Sez: June, 2021|work=And It Don't Stop|access-date=17 June 2021}}</ref>}}
