the one where we had more of a handle on the creativity. Not to say that the pressure wasn't on. We were touring constantly, we only took time off to go in the studio. No one said: 'Take a month off, go write some songs.' It was like: 'Go in the studio with whatever ideas you have.' That was how it was. ''Toys'' was kind of the softball album, and ''Rocks'' was the one were we felt: 'Wow, we're there'."<ref>Everley, Dave. ‘I Looked at Drugs as a Short Cut to the Subconscious’: An Epic Interview with Aerosmith's Joe Perry.

Contemporary reviews were mixed. John Milward of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that "the material is ''Rocks''’ major flaw, mostly pale remakes of their earlier hits"; concluding that the return to the "ear-boxing sound" of ''Get Your Wings'' and Tyler's vocal performance cannot save the album from mediocrity.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingst
